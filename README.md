# travel_demo
This project contains a curated list of places/tourist attractions in almost all the states in Nigeria.
Each place has a description and a view in map option.
View in map simply redirects to a web browser and opens the location of the place on GoogleMaps.
It also includes a Restaurants and Hotels section. These sections show nearly all the states and also have the view in map option.
Places can also be saved, this is stored locally using shared preferences.
